            <p>Whatever it is you're looking for, this certainly isn't it.</p>
            <p>How ironic. A 404 error on the404. Could be worse, at least it's not a 403 error.</p>
            <p>
                You really shouldn't be here, anyways. Why don't you head on <a href="http://www.the404.nl/" class="link">home?</a>
                <br> If you're looking for the Mario 64 Colour Code thing, it's now over on Github, you'll find it <a href="https://github.com/the404devs/sm64code" class="link">here.</a>
