I'm sure you've heard about the Mario 64 PC port that was all possible thanks to the team that spent months working to decompile the game's source.

It's time to break out the balloons and confetti, because we're gonna <b>celebrate!</b> It's time to party like it's 2018, and 404 will have a special retro look just for this occasion. Yup, you read that right, I'm bringing back the shitty 5-second css job I did on my phone the moment Z transferred the site to me.

If only the Ocarina of Time Randomizer craze had lasted longer than a few weeks... Oh well. I really do want to pick it up again, but the tedious work that I need to do is really off-putting.

As you probably expected, because I've been saying it in every single goddamn post on this site for the last year, 404 has been on the backburner.

								<h4 class='post-date'>09/07/2019</h4>
								<p class='post-body'>Big backend changes have come to The404! <br><br> Yeah, I know nothing looks different, but trust me, its called "backend" for a reason. These blog posts are now saved as individual JSON files, which are then processed by a bit of shoddy PHP that spits out some nicely formatted HTML. This is a much nicer way of doing it, rather than manually adding them to the <b>index.html</b>. This has shrunk the index file by over 100 lines, and I plan on doing something similar for the <b>Software</b> tab, which should remove about 200 more. That's a <b>tomorrow</b> problem, though. (09/08/19: That problem has now been dealt with.)<br><br>I've begun my second year of CS here at Ryerson, and I've even taking a <b>Web Development Systems</b> course, just so I can make this site even better than it already is. Take that, <a class='link' href='http://the403.tk'>Z</a>. Other courses are pretty standard, I'll be learning C/C++, which is something I actually meant to do over the summer but was too lazy to start. I'll also be learning about Linux, but as someone who's been using Fedora for nearly a year now, I think I'll be ok. <br><br> The rest of my classes are either pretty lame (Data Structures), pretty scary (Linear Algebra), or pretty bullshit (Communication in the Computer Industry - like what the fuck). Wish me luck.<br><br>At the moment, my workload is pretty light, but as it's only been a week, I doubt that will last. 404 will remain my top priority in my spare time, regardless of how much time that actually is. Maybe I'll even finish <a class='link' href='zootr'>ZOOTR</a>, who knows?<br><br>Happy September, everyone!</p>

That's alright, it gives me a good reason to overhaul this site.<br><br>One month after the whole domain kerfuffle, things are running smoothly. 404, as you may have noticed, has gotten a bit of a redesign! More changes under the hood will come later, for my own convenience.<br><br>This month, on the 11th and 14th, respectively, is the 1-year anniversary of Iconify and Spectrum, two little tools I created out of boredom over the March Break.

On February 12th, Freenom, the company from which I got the domain <b>the404.ml</b>, abruptly canceled it. <br><br> No explanation was given, other than a vague "violates our terms of service." Having no idea what this violation was, I've decided that I'm done with that company, and bought our new domain, <b>the404.nl</b>.

								<p>Yet again another C# project from Grade 11, this time it required the use of string functions and sorting algorithms. We spent too much time on making it look good and forgot to look at the rubric, which said it needed to be Hangman with a creative twist. As a result we branded ours as a sequel to the original that's exactly the same, because Hangman doesn't need anything new. Apparently that was creative enough to satisfy the requirements, because we got 99% on it.</p>

								<p>The game that sparked so many memes. This was our final project for Grade 11, and our teacher said we could make whatever we wanted so long as it used everything we learned this year. Normally, we would get a month to work on it but because our class was so behind we only had 10 days for it. We wasted the first few days trying to think of something to do, because we had no real ideas. <br>Eventually we got stuck with this idea, which was suggested by me as a joke. We had big plans for it, but because we only had 2 weeks and we focused mostly on the classroom moving system we had to cut out a whole lot. Thanks to bonus marks and a popularity contest (of course our game is the class favourite when literally everyone in the class is in the game), we got 102%. <br>We planed on doing a 2018 edition for our summative the next year, everyone including our teacher asked for a sequel, but we decided to make something a little different. <br><br>Computer Science Simulator: <s>2019</s> <s>2020</s> 2021 Edition coming soon?</p>

								<p>Our first project for Grade 12 ICS, we had to use PHP to make a quiz website. We based ours around our favourite game. I put in a lot of work to make it look really good without realizing I was actually doing super-advanced stuff (for the level of experience of the class, that is). Our teacher liked it, and put it on his "hall of fame," and we got away with 100%. It was super fun to make, and there are a whole bunch of different GIFs you'll see at the end depending on your mark.</p>

								<p>We started with Java in Grade 12, and our first Java project was to create a game in a Java console program. We settled on Connect 4, simply because we thought we could throw in a bunch of shitty Connect 4 memes, which were relevant back then. The AI was the highlight of the game, because we actually made it try and stop the player from winning by looking for 3-in-a-rows, instead of our boring original AI that just picked a random spot. You can play with a friend or against the computer. Another easy 100%.</p>

								<p>A dumb meme that I had wanted to make for a while, and we saw a golden opportunity to finish it when we were asked to create a game implementing some sort of algorithm. Channeling our inner Al Gore, we created this simple game where you navigate Waluigi around a room collecting the right tacos to serve to Mario. The room is completely random each time, generated using the Random Walk algorithm. Originally, Waluigi was gonna be collecting different ingredients (lettuce, tomato, etc) but we got lazy and decided to recolour the same taco image a few times to represent different types of tacos. Let it be known we did it before Kaze did.</p>

								<p>A really low-effort Java game for Grade 12 CS. The website was designed to look like a blatant rip off of the Connect 4 one. This project was centered around OOP. The best thing about the game is the AI. The game creates enough AI players as it needs to so there is always a 4-player match, and early on into coding the part which checks how many people are playing and creates the correct of AIs so there are 4 players, I realized the user could simply say 0 people are playing, causing the game to create a match between 4 AI players. This was fun to play around with, so I just left it in. It can take up to an hour (I've timed it before) for one of the AIs to win. AI players are assigned random names, most of which are memes. Sometimes, the AI players will say rude comments or dumb CS jokes or other random things after their turns. There are plenty of memes in the taunts as well. Only fun because of the AI, but you can play with friends as well.</p>

								<p>This was our final project for Grade 12 CS, and we went big for this one. We didn't want a repeat of last year's project (ICS Sim), so we decided to make a text-based adventure with a horror theme. Since we based it around Mario 64, though, it ended up being more meme-y than spooky. Shoutouts to Nathaniel Bandy. This was so much fun to make, once we made a system for the game to load each different part of the story from a file all that was left was to make the actual story and the paths each choice would lead the player down. Most of that story was done the night before it was due, and a couple events are missing images because I kind of forgot them (oops). The actual game is all Java, and there's a website with registration and a leaderboard that goes along with it. We ended up with 98% overall, only losing marks on the small stuff before the final submission (you'll see the different stages in the site). I will definitely build on this in the future.<br><br><b>v1.2 (09/01/18):</b> Added a "large screen" mode.</p>

								<p>A custom start page for your browser. Configured to use colours generated by <a class='link' href='https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal'>Pywal</a>, so it'll fit in nicely with your rice.<br>Conveniently enough, I also have a fork of <b>Pywal</b> that fixes an issue on KDE Plasma, and conveniently enough, it's the next entry on this list. <br><br><b>v0.1.4 (05/08/20):</b> Eliminated hardcoded values, allowing for more accessibility and customization. Changed README to be more useful. Added sample colour file to be used as fallback if no <b>pywal</b> colours exist.<br><b>v0.1.5 (05/25/20):</b> Configuration has been streamlined, with all config values set in a single file. Added experimental support for making this page the new tab page on Chrome with an extension. I've used this page as my new tab page since I first made it, so I thought it was time to make that a configurable thing. Setup process found in the README, as always.<br><b>v0.1.6 (06/03/20):</b> Rewritten CSS to make it easier to naviagte and modify. Added local copies of fonts. Consistency changes.

								<p>A fork of dylanaraps' <a class='link' href='https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal'>Pywal</a>, an amazing command-line tool that allows you to set your wallpaper, and generates a matching colour-scheme for your terminal. It also exports those colours in a CSS format (among others), which can be easily be used by other applications to unify your desktop experience. (For example, VSCode and my custom browser start page both take colours from Pywal.)<br>For some strange reason, pywal fails to set the wallpaper on KDE Plasma, leaving the user to manually change the wallpaper. As a Plasma user, I found this rather inconvenient, so I fixed it.</p>
