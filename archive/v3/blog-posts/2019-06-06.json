Inspired by <a class='link' href='https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-GB/'>Thimble</a>, as well as ideas we've been throwing around the library for web design workshops, it will retain it's core element of collaboration,as well as a preview function, allowing web content to be created and viewed in real time. <br><br>Sounds pretty cool, eh? I'll probably append more information about this project to this post as it becomes available <b>(read: as I come up with it)</b> <br><br>If you're interested in checking out 404Editor, you'll find it <a class='link' href='https://the404devs.github.io/404-editor/'>here.</a><br><br>Cheers!"
