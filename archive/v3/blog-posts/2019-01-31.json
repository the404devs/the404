    "Content": "I've begun my first year of my Computer Science degree, and after a semester of using Jython (a horrendous abomination of Python and Java that needs to be sent to the depths of hell) to modify pictures (yes, a whole semester of that shit), we have moved on to bigger and better things.<br>We are now using Java, and if you've seen my spaghetti code <a href='https://the404devs.github.io/connect4' class='link'>Connect 4</a> from last year, you know I'm an old pro with clunky old Java. <br>Not much is happening here for the foreseeable future, as I'm pretty busy with baby's-first-programming, as well as my other classes.<br><br>From time to time I will be continuing work on a side project I began over Christmas, a tracker for Ocarina of Time Randomizer. You can find that <a href='zootr' class='link'>here</a>, and if you have no idea what OoTR is, you should check it out <a href='https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer' class='link'>here</a>.<br>As for the other things I was working on, they are either complete and you'll find them under the 'Software' tab, or they've been consumed by the endless void. I'm sure once the summer comes, I'll have a bit more time to devote to this site, so I'll certainly be seeing y'all in 4 months, if not sooner.<br><br>On an unrelated note, this site celebrated its first birthday on January 18th, so shoutouts to <a href='http://the403.tk/' class='link'>Z</a>, who sold me his old site for a cent.<br><br>Happy 2019 y'all!"
