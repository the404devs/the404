    "Description": "A custom start page for your browser. Configured to use colours generated by <a class='link' href='https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal'>Pywal</a>, so it'll fit in nicely with your rice.<br>Conveniently enough, I also have a fork of <b>Pywal</b> that fixes an issue on KDE Plasma, and conveniently enough, it's the next entry on this list. <br><br><b>v0.1.4 (05/08/20):</b> Eliminated hardcoded values, allowing for more accessibility and customization. Changed README to be more useful. Added sample colour file to be used as fallback if no <b>pywal</b> colours exist.<br><b>v0.1.5 (05/25/20):</b> Configuration has been streamlined, with all config values set in a single file. Added experimental support for making this page the new tab page on Chrome with an extension. I've used this page as my new tab page since I first made it, so I thought it was time to make that a configurable thing. Setup process found in the README, as always.<br><b>v0.1.6 (06/03/20):</b> Rewritten CSS to make it easier to naviagte and modify. Added local copies of fonts. Consistency changes. Added tentative icon."
