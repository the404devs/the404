    "Description": "Our first project for Grade 12 ICS, we had to use PHP to make a quiz website. We based ours around our favourite game. I put in a lot of work to make it look really good without realizing I was actually doing super-advanced stuff (for the level of experience of the class, that is). Our teacher liked it, and put it on his \"hall of fame,\" and we got away with 100%. It was super fun to make, and there are a whole bunch of different GIFs you'll see at the end depending on your mark."
