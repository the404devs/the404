			            			I will be redesigning the site over the next little while, both inside and out, so expect some big changes soon.

			            			In the meantime, ZOOTR is slowly starting to come together, and the most tedious parts of development are nearly complete.

			            			Didn't think I'd be updating again so soon, but this is important. On February 12th, Freenom, the company from which I got the domain <b>the404.ml</b>, abruptly canceled it. 
			            			<br><br> 
			            			No explanation was given, other than a vague "violates our terms of service." Having no idea what this violation was, I've decided that I'm done with that company, and bought our new domain, <b>www.the404.nl</b>. While we will mourn the loss of that one hump, I'm sure the move from Mali to the Netherlands will be worth it. 
			            			<br><br>

			            			</ul>
			            			I should also mention that I will be moving all of my existing projects to GitHub, to make my life easier, and to free up space on my various Google Drive accounts (apparently 3 separate accounts still isn't enough for me). This means download links will be changing, so if anything seems broken, please let me know.

				            		I've begun my first year of my Computer Science degree, and after a semester of using Jython (a horrendous abomination of Python and Java that needs to be sent to the depths of hell) to modify pictures (yes, a whole semester of that shit), we have moved on to bigger and better things.
				            		<br>
				            		We are now using Java, and if you've seen my spaghetti code <a href="software/connect4/" class="link">Connect 4</a> from last year, you know I'm an old pro with clunky old Java. 
				            		<br>
				            		Not much is happening here for the foreseeable future, as I'm pretty busy with baby's-first-programming, as well as my other classes.
				            		<br>
				            		<br>
				            		From time to time I will be continuing work on a side project I began over Christmas, a tracker for Ocarina of Time Randomizer. You can find that <a href="zootr" class="link">here</a>, and if you have no idea what OoTR is, you should check it out <a href="https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer" class="link">here</a>.
				            		<br>
				            		As for the other things I was working on, they are either complete and you'll find them under the 'Software' tab, or they've been consumed by the endless void. I'm sure once the summer comes, I'll have a bit more time to devote to this site, so I'll certainly be seeing y'all in 4 months, if not sooner.
				            		<br>
				            		<br>
				            		On an unrelated note, this site celebrated its first birthday on January 18th, so shoutouts to <a href="http://the403.tk/" class="link">Z</a>, who sold me his old site for a cent.
				            		<br>
				            		<br>

									<li><b>Description:</b> <br>Yet again another C# project from Grade 11, this time it required the use of string functions and sorting algorithms. We spent too much time on making it look good and forgot to look at the rubric, which said it needed to be Hangman with a creative twist. As a result we branded ours as a sequel to the original that's exactly the same, because Hangman doesn't need anything new. Apparently that was creative enough to satisfy the requirements, because we got 99% on it.</li>

									<li><b>Description:</b> <br>The game that sparked so many memes. This was our final project for Grade 11, and our teacher said we could make whatever we wanted so long as it used everything we learned this year. Normally, we would get a month to work on it but because our class was so behind we only had 10 days for it. We wasted the first few days trying to think of something to do, because we had no real ideas. Eventually we got stuck with this idea, which was suggested by me as a joke. We had big plans for it, but because we only had 2 weeks and we focused mostly on the classroom moving system we had to cut out a whole lot. Thanks to bonus marks and a popularity contest (of course our game is the class favourite when literally everyone in the class is in the game), we got 102%. We planed on doing a 2018 edition for our summative the next year, everyone including our teacher asked for a sequel, but we decided to make something a little different. Computer Science Simulator: 2019 Edition coming soon?</li>

We settled on Connect 4, simply because we thought we could throw in a bunch of shitty Connect 4 memes, which were relevant back then. The AI was the highlight of the game, because we actually made it try and stop the player from winning by looking for 3-in-a-rows, instead of our boring original AI that just picked a random spot. You can play with a friend or against the computer. Another easy 100%.</li>

									<li><b>Description:</b> <br>A dumb meme that I had wanted to make for a while, and we saw a golden opportunity to finish it when we were asked to create a game implementing some sort of algorithm. Channeling our inner Al Gore, we created this simple game where you navigate Waluigi around a room collecting the right tacos to serve to Mario. The room is completely random each time, generated using the Random Walk algorithm. Originally, Waluigi was gonna be collecting different ingredients (lettuce, tomato, etc) but we got lazy and decided to recolour the same taco image a few times to represent different types of tacos. Let it be known we did it before Kaze did.</li>

									<li><b>Description:</b> <br>A really low-effort Java game for Grade 12 CS. The website was designed to look like a blatant rip off of the Connect 4 one. This project was centered around OOP. The best thing about the game is the AI. The game creates enough AI players as it needs to so there is always a 4-player match, and early on into coding the part which checks how many people are playing and creates the correct of AIs so there are 4 players, I realized the user could simply say 0 people are playing, causing the game to create a match between 4 AI players. This was fun to play around with, so I just left it in. It can take up to an hour (I've timed it before) for one of the AIs to win. AI players are assigned random names, most of which are memes. Sometimes, the AI players will say rude comments or dumb CS jokes or other random things after their turns. There are plenty of memes in the taunts as well. Only fun because of the AI, but you can play with friends as well.</li>

									<li><b>Description:</b> <br>This was our final project for Grade 12 CS, and we went big for this one. We didn't want a repeat of last year's project (ICS Sim), so we decided to make a text-based adventure with a horror theme. Since we based it around Mario 64, though, it ended up being more meme-y than spooky. Shoutouts to Nathaniel Bandy. This was so much fun to make, once we made a system for the game to load each different part of the story from a file all that was left was to make the actual story and the paths each choice would lead the player down. Most of that story was done the night before it was due, and a couple events are missing images because I kind of forgot them (oops). The actual game is all Java, and there's a website with registration and a leaderboard that goes along with it. We ended up with 98% overall, only losing marks on the small stuff before the final submission (you'll see the different stages in the site). I will definitely build on this in the future.<br>Update 1.2 (09/01/18): Added a "large screen" mode.</li>

			            		404Editor was something I came up with in May 2018 out of a need to work on something other than our current CS assignment (Crazy 8s, go check it out). It is an "intuitive" text editor with syntax highlighting for various languages. Its key component is its collaborative nature, allowing multiple users to work on the same thing at the same time from any device. It has been described (by myself, to someone who doesn't understand computers that well) as a Google Docs for code. You can also set a password when creating a workspace, but its not required. Anyone wishing to work in someone's workspace will need to know the workspace name, as well as the password, if there is one.<br><br>On a side note, don't ever type on the same line as somebody else unless you want to destroy all of your hard work. Crazy stuff happens, and I haven't really figured out how to fix it yet.
