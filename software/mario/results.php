	Mr. Krnic
	March 2nd, 2018

			<!--Main page content
				More PHP code, this time we're gonna load up the seesionfo.txt file.
				Get the ID number the user gave us in results.html
					(If the ID doesn't actually exist, we show a message telling the user so)
				Create an array from the contents of 'sessions/<ID number>/sessioninfo.txt'
					Remember how the answers are separated by commas?
					Well, we use that to our advantage while creating this array.
				Cycle through each element of the array of user answers, and compare it to the array we made of the correct answers.
				When the answer is correct, we add 1 to the total number of correct answers.
				If it's wrong, we echo out a message, saying what question was wrong and what the right answer was.
				Echo out the user's score, we even calculate their percentage.
				Display a different image of MArio, depending on how well they did.-->
