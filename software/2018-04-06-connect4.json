    "Description": "We started with Java in Grade 12, and our first Java project was to create a game in a Java console program. We settled on Connect 4, simply because we thought we could throw in a bunch of shitty Connect 4 memes, which were relevant back then. The AI was the highlight of the game, because we actually made it try and stop the player from winning by looking for 3-in-a-rows, instead of our boring original AI that just picked a random spot. You can play with a friend or against the computer. Another easy 100%."
