    "Description": "Yet again another C# project from Grade 11, this time it required the use of string functions and sorting algorithms. We spent too much time on making it look good and forgot to look at the rubric, which said it needed to be Hangman with a creative twist. As a result we branded ours as a sequel to the original that's exactly the same, because Hangman doesn't need anything new. Apparently that was creative enough to satisfy the requirements, because we got 99% on it."
