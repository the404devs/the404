				Welcome to my website, where I host assorted things that may come in handy someday.
				<br>
				I started 404 on January 18, 2018, because I felt like it. Then some stuff happened and this is the result. Ta-da.

				February 20th, 2018. One of my greatest achievements, getting 404 blocked by the school board. How did it get blocked, you ask? Blame the fake gmail sign-in I made that saves whatever info you input to my server. If you play around with it don't actually put in your real info, I don't want it.

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Computer Science Meme-ories</h3> 
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/blackjack.png" width="50px">Blackjack (April 2017)</span> 
			<p>Our first project from Grade 11 ICS. Used C# to create a version of Blackjack that works well, most of the time. First game I ever made.</p> 
			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/HangmanIcon.png" width="50px">Hangman (May 2017)</span> 
			<p>Yet again another C# project, this time it required the use of string functions and sorting algorithms. We spent too much time on making it look good and forgot to look at the rubric, which said it needed to be Hangman with a creative twist. As a result we branded ours as a sequel to the original that's exactly the same, because Hangman doesn't need anything new. Apparently that was creative enough to satisfy the requirements, because we got 99% on it.

			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/cs17.png" width="50px">Computer Science Simulator (June 2017)</span> 
			<p>The game that sparked so many memes. This was our final project for Grade 11, and our teacher said we could make whatever we wanted so long as it used everything we learned this year. Normally, we would get a month to work on it but because our class was so behind we only had 2 weeks for it. We wasted the first few days trying to think of something to do, because we had no real ideas. Eventually we got stuck with this idea, which was suggested by me as a joke. We had big plans for it, but because we only had 2 weeks and we focussed mostly on the classroom moving system we had to cut out a whole lot. Thanks to bonus marks and a popularity contest (of course our game is the class favourite when literally everyone in the class is in the game), we got 102%.</p> 
			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/mariohead.png" width="50px">Super Mario 64 Quiz (March 2018)</span> 
			<p>First project for Grade 12 ICS, had to use PHP to make a quiz webiste. We based ours around our favourite game. I put in a lot of work to make it look really good without realizing I was actually doing super-advanced stuff. Our teacher liked it, and put it on his "hall of fame," and we got away with 100%. It was super fun to make, and there are a whole bunch of different GIFs you'll see at the end depending on your mark.

			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/connect4.png" width="50px">Connect Four (April 2018)</span> 
			<p>We started with Java in Grade 12, and our first Java project was to create a game in a Java console program. We settled on Connect 4, simply because we thought we could throw in a bunch of shitty Connect 4 memes. AI was the highlight of the game. Another easy 100%. 
				<a href="software/connect4/index.html">Connect 4 webpage</a></p> 
			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/taco.png" width="50px">Waluigi's Taco Stand (May 2018)</span> 
			<p>I still laugh over this one. It was something I sort of planned on making for a while, but never had the motivation to finish. We saw a golden opportunity to make it a reality, and that's what we did for our second Java assignment. It was a total meme and a half and we had such a good time making it. Maybe someday I'll expand on it, who knows?

			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/crazy8.png" width="50px">Crazy 8s (May 2018)</span> 
			<p>Another Java console-based game, this time implementing OOP. It was crazy, man.

			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"><img src="images/bup.bmp" width="50px">Super Mario 64: Toad's Terror (June 2018)</span> 
			<p>This was our final project for Grade 12 CS, and we went big for this one. We didn't want a repeat of last year's project (ICS Sim), so we decided to make a text-based adventure with a horror theme. Since we based it around Mario 64, though, it ended up being more meme-y than spooky. Shoutouts to Nathaniel Bandy. The actual game is all Java, and there's a website with registration and a leaderboard that goes along with it. We ended up with 98% overall, only losing marks on the small stuff before the final submission (you'll see the different stages in the site). I will definitely build on this in the future.
