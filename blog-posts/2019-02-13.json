On February 12th, Freenom, the company from which I got the domain <b>the404.ml</b>, abruptly canceled it. <br><br> No explanation was given, other than a vague \"violates our terms of service.\" Having no idea what this violation was, I've decided that I'm done with that company, and bought our new domain, <b>the404.nl</b>. While we will mourn the loss of that one hump, I'm sure the move from Mali to the Netherlands will be worth it. <br><br>I feel obligated to list the things I am working on this month, so here it is.<ul><li>ZOOTR Tracker, active development will resume on the 16th</li><li>A top-secret project, which will be revealed later.</li></ul>I should also mention that I will be moving all of my existing projects to GitHub, to make my life easier, and to free up space on my various Google Drive accounts (apparently 3 separate accounts still isn't enough for me). This means download links will be changing, so if anything seems broken, please let me know.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><p style='font-size:9px'>PS: I just realized I now have to change every link on this site to .nl. Shit.</p>"
