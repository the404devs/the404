I'm currently at the most tedious stage of development, which is dealing a big hit to my interest in the project.It will be finished by the summer, I can guarantee that. </p><p style='font-size:9px'>no promises though</p><br>The gang and I are brainstorming ideas for a summer side-project, and one such idea has been to transform 404Editor into a fully-functioning web-based IDE.Regardless of whether or not we choose to go with that, I'll likely be putting some time into revamping 404Editor, maybe even a full rewrite, in time for its 1-year anniversary next month.<br><br>This month in 404 history, we have <a class='link' href='https://the404devs.github.io/connect4'>Connect 4</a>, the first project from Grade 12 CS using Java, released on April 6th, 2018. One year on, I'm still quite proud of it, until I look at the source. This was before we'd learned OOP, so it is quite the pile of spaghetti.<br>It works quite smoothly considering its limitations, and was worth all 100 percentage points it earned us.<br><br>In other news, the redesign is finished, just in time for 4/04 celebrations <p style='font-size:9px'>I'm not the only one celebrating, right?</p>While some tweaks might be made, I'm overall satisfied with it, and I think it reflects my current interests quite well.<br><br>That's all for April, cheers!"
