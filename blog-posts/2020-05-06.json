It's been a few months.<br><br>Well, since we're all stuck at home anyways, why not take some time to revist 2018's hit game <a class='link' href='https://the404devs.github.io/taco_stand'>Waluigi's Taco Stand</a>? <br>Or, if you're looking for something a little more retro and legally questionable, look no further than <a class='link' href=software/sm64pc/sm64.us.f3dex2e.tar.gz>Super Mario 64 on Linux</a>. I'm sure you've heard about the Mario 64 PC port that was all possible thanks to the team that spent months working to decompile the game's source. All I did was take that source, and compile it to a Linux binary that should work on most distros (testing in progress).<br><br>If anyone asks, this port doesn't exist and you never heard of it.<br><p style='font-size:9px'>it's a secret to everybody</p><br><b>Update (05/16/20):</b> I've discovered some earth-shattering secret lore about the404 that changes everything I thought I knew about this site's past. Because of this, I have now created official <a class='link' href='lore-o-lore'>404 Lore-O-Lore</a></b> to serve as an account of 404's pre-2018 history. Quick, somebody make a theory video about this shit!"
