            <p>This is an archive of 404's history, featuring screenshots and the like.</p>
            <p>
                The404 was originally created on February 11, 2017 by my good friend
                <a class="link" href="https://the403.ml">Zeeshan</a>, who used it for pretty much the same thing I do, until I bought the site off him for the small price of 1¢ on January 18, 2018.

                    <p>
                        The earliest screenshot I have of the404. This was 404's initial design (v0), and was faithfully recreated in 2020 to be used on
                        <a class="link" href="birthday.html">404's Birthday.</a> This version of the site has not been preserved, and was recreated entirely from this single screenshot.

                    <p>Later that same day, I created the v3 site (seen on the left). This was another full rewrite of the404.</p>

                    <p>v3.3, which introduced some font variation (thank god), and a more traditional colourscheme. This screenshot was taken to show off Firefox's wonky rendering of the top-left tabs.</p>

                    <p>For v3.5, I took a big step into the unknown with a new colourscheme. It was nice, but needed a few tweaks.</p>

                    <h4>April 25, 2020</h4>
                    <p>In February, I tweaked the colours again for v3.6, giving it a bit of a 'sunset' feel. 404 didn't see much activity for the next few months as school consumed every ounce of spare time.</p>

                    <p>
                        Something about the sunset colours just weren't doing it for me, so I completely overhauled them once again, featuring the iconic 404 purple, as well as a retro teal colour that was used heavily as an accent back in the v1 days. v3.7.2 is archived

                        Early June 2020 saw many unexpected changes to the404. On the 6th, the hosting provider 404 had used since it's creation suspended the site without warning or reason.
                        <br> If it weren't for my own due diligence in taking regular backups content,I would have lost a significant portion of the site. Thankfully, nothing was lost, and I moved the site over to Github Pages over the next day.
                        <br> This move required a full rewrite of the site's internals, which made heavy use of PHP. GHP doesn't support PHP, so a migration to JS and Firebase was necessary. This is the current iteration of the site, v4.

                        v4.0.4, the version number I had been waiting to reach for years (ok, maybe only a week or so since v4.0.0). This is the 404 joke to end all 404 jokes.
                        <br> There was nothing particularly special about this update other than some bug fixes and some design polishing, but it was still legendary nonetheless.
