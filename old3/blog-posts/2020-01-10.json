It's time to break out the balloons and confetti, because we're gonna <b>celebrate!</b> It's time to party like it's 2018, and 404 will have a special retro look just for this occasion. Yup, you read that right, I'm bringing back the shitty 5-second css job I did on my phone the moment Z transferred the site to me. Nostalgia is a powerful thing, you know.<br><br> <img src='img/nostalgia.png' class='body-image' title='Ah, the good old days'><br><br>Dust off that Segoe UI, crack open the teal paint, round off those corners, and re-hire the spooky skeleton, we're bringing it all back in 2020!<br><br>Other news: The MC server is now running version 1.15.1. Remember that you can check the status in the About tab. <br><br>Happy 2020 everyone, and here's to another year of the404!<br><br><b>PS:</b> Speaking of another year of 404, I've successfully renewed our domain <b>the404.nl</b> for another year, which means the site should remain at this location until February 2021! Woohoo!"
