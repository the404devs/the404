		"Content": "It seems these updates have become a monthly occurrence. That's alright, it gives me a good reason to overhaul this site.<br><br>One month after the whole domain kerfuffle, things are running smoothly. 404, as you may have noticed, has gotten a bit of a redesign! More changes under the hood will come later, for my own convenience.<br><br>This month, on the 11th and 14th, respectively, is the 1-year anniversary of Iconify and Spectrum, two little tools I created out of boredom over the March Break. I don't use Windows very often anymore, but when I find myself using Windows as a development platform, both of these have come in quite handy. Both of these can be found in the 'Software' section of the site.<br><br>In the meantime, ZOOTR is slowly starting to come together, and the most tedious parts of development are nearly complete.<br>As always, you can stay up to date with ZOOTR <a class='link' href='https://github.com/the404devs/zootr-tracker'>here</a>, as updates are pushed every so often. I have been very busy with school this month, and that will likely continue into April until I finish exams.<br><br>That's all for the moment, so take care!<br><br><b>UWaterloo now blocks my site. Sick. I don't even go there.</b>"
