He then abandoned it in favour of the clearly inferior the403.'><br><br>Things have been hella crazy around here this past month or so. I've had midterms the last week, and there's still a few major assignments I'm working on. As you probably expected, because I've been saying it in every single goddamn post on this site for the last year, 404 has been on the backburner. I really do want to get back into the swing of things here, I've had a few waves of inspiration, but no time to capitalize on them.<br><br>October 25th marks one year since I first switched to Fedora Linux. While this doesn't really effect 404, its something I'm quite happy about. I'm also considering setting up a dedicated server for 404, so look out for that in the future.<br><br><b>Update (11/20/19):</b> Go and fuck up Mario's face with this thing I did for an assignment. <br><a class='link' href='cps530/lab7'>Mario Face Fuckerizer</a>"
