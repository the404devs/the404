I've given the site a bit of a new coat of paint, with some under-the-hood changes coming as well.<br><br>I've also created a 404 Minecraft server. Why? I don't know.<br>Connect to <b>mc.the404.nl</b> to see it for yourself. The server currently runs version <b>1.14.4</b>, and is down for the majority of of the time.I only turn it on when I want to use it, and, lets face it, traffic on this site isn't exactly frequent. If you're reading this, you know how to contact me, so if you want it running for some reason, just let me know.<br><br>Not too much is going on in my world at the moment, mostly just gearing up for another school year.<br><br>That's all I've got at this time, as my motivation seems to be at rock-bottom. Cheers!"
