    "Description": "A dumb meme that I had wanted to make for a while, and we saw a golden opportunity to finish it when we were asked to create a game implementing some sort of algorithm. Channeling our inner Al Gore, we created this simple game where you navigate Waluigi around a room collecting the right tacos to serve to Mario. The room is completely random each time, generated using the Random Walk algorithm. Originally, Waluigi was gonna be collecting different ingredients (lettuce, tomato, etc) but we got lazy and decided to recolour the same taco image a few times to represent different types of tacos. Let it be known we did it before Kaze did."
