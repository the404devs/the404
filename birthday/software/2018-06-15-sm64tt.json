    "Description": "This was our final project for Grade 12 CS, and we went big for this one. We didn't want a repeat of last year's project (ICS Sim), so we decided to make a text-based adventure with a horror theme. Since we based it around Mario 64, though, it ended up being more meme-y than spooky. Shoutouts to Nathaniel Bandy. This was so much fun to make, once we made a system for the game to load each different part of the story from a file all that was left was to make the actual story and the paths each choice would lead the player down. Most of that story was done the night before it was due, and a couple events are missing images because I kind of forgot them (oops). The actual game is all Java, and there's a website with registration and a leaderboard that goes along with it. We ended up with 98% overall, only losing marks on the small stuff before the final submission (you'll see the different stages in the site). I will definitely build on this in the future.<br><br><b>v1.2 (09/01/18):</b> Added a \"large screen\" mode."
