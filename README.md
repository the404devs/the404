# the404
http://the404.nl/

The404 is my personal site, where I speak my mind and host all sorts of things I've created over the years.

The current iteration of The404 was created on January 18th, 2018. The404 originally belonged to my good friend Zeeshan, who sold me the site for a whopping 1 cent. He now has a new site called The403. 404 is **clearly** better.

Owing to some hosting troubles unfolding at the moment, I'm hastily chucking the site on Github, with plans to migrate the thing to Github Pages in the near future. This means replacing all of the PHP code (including the stuff I just wrote a few hours ago, sigh) with something else. F in the chat, boys.

### *3.7.2 (06/06/20)*
----------------------
- Added navigation menu to blog pane, allowing for easy finding of the different articles.
- Added framework for tag-based filter on software pane.
- Chucked onto Github due to hosting troubles. Will likely migrate to Github Pages in the coming days.
