# the404
https://the404.nl/

The404 is my personal site, where I speak my mind and host all sorts of things I've created over the years.

The current iteration of The404 was created on January 18th, 2018. The404 originally belonged to my good friend Zeeshan, who sold me the site for a whopping 1 cent. He now has a new site called The403. 404 is **clearly** better.

### *4.1.7 (10/23/2021)*
------------------------
- Lots of CSS fixes and changes.
    - Firefox doesn't support `backdrop-filter` out of the box, so elements meant to use that property are now opaque on Firefox.
    - Use `-moz-available` in places where `-webkit-fill-available` is used, to get the same behavior on Firefox.
    - Adjusted the green-purple background gradient to be a bit smoother.
    - Removed `display: table;` from `.content`, not sure why it was there anyways.
    - `.prev` and `.next` arrow buttons used on image galleries now have a fixed size of 55px x 55px.
    - Removed a few inline styles, more to come.
- Tiny bit of housekeeping here and there. 

### *4.1.6 (05/25/2021)*
------------------------
- Major CSS rewrite, creating separate stylesheets for different things.
    - Unless I did something wrong, everything should look the same.

### *4.1.5 (01/18/2021)*
------------------------
- the404's 3rd birthday!
- Lots of changes to `admin.html` and `archive/index.html`, because the museum entries are now stored in Firebase like everything else!
    - Split the About pane of the admin page into 2 columns, one containing the existing feedback stuff.
    - The other holds the museum stuff, and is very similar to the other 2 panes.
    - Some style tweaks to go along with this stuff.
    - The museum page now loads from Firebase, that code can be found in `js/gallery.js`

### *4.1.4 (01/12/2021)*
------------------------
- Did some housekeeping, cleaned things up a bit.
    - Moved `museum.html` to `archive/index.html`, the museum images are now in there too. 
    - Chucked `lore-o-lore` and `the403` in there too.
    - Moved `software/waluigi` to `development/waluigi`, and removed the temporary redirect page at `software/sm64code`
        - ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ `software` directory is gone ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
    - Removed old JS files `js/remove-branding.js` and `js/html2canvas.min.js`, since they're unused.
    - Fixed up my old graph assignment page at `development/mario.html`, so now the links on that page work again.
- Renewed domain for another year, expires 02/12/2022.
- A few styling fixes.

### *4.1.3 (01/08/2021)*
------------------------
- Lots of changes to the Projects tab.
    - Added an ID-based nav menu, similar to the Blog tab.
    - Tag and Language sorting is still there, those now affect the ID menu too.
    - Projects tab now sorts ascending (newest-first) by default. You can switch to descending by hitting the â†‘/â†“ button in the nav menu.
- Implemented an ID-based nav menu on the Projects tab of the admin page (no tag/language sorting, didn't need it).
- Changed the window width at which the nav menus auto-hide themselves.
    - Was 850px, now 1000px.
- Also reduced width of blobs on the admin page.
- Post/Project ids are also shown in small text at the bottom of each blob (or in large text at the top when on the admin page). 
- Some little styling tweaks to make sure each page looks the same.

### *4.1.2 (01/01/2021)*
------------------------
- Revamp Birthday page in prep for upcoming birthday.
    - Now uses the Firebase DB like the index page, meaning it's now low maintenance.
    - Easter egg automatically activates between Jan. 17th and 19th of each year.
    - Removed `/birthday` directory, since it was pretty redundant.
- Reorganize the archives
    - `/old` is now `/archive/v1`
    - `/old2` is now `/archive/v2`
    - `/old3` is now `/archive/v3`

### *4.1.1 (10/31/2020)*

### *4.0.8 (08/02/2020)*
------------------------

### *4.0.7 (07/29/2020)*

    - This stops the user from getting sent back to the home tab once stuff actually loads.
- Removed some unnecessary debug output.
- Fixed text alignment in tabs.
- Buttons are 31px tall again. I guess it was just a bug in Chrome's renderer.
- Better-looking error messages when logging into the admin zone.
- All projects have an *xxxx.the404.nl* subdomain, some links have been changed accordingly.

### *4.0.6 (07/14/2020)*
------------------------
- Buttons are now 30px tall, instead of 31px. The text was slightly off-centre, which was destroying my soul.
- Both Blog and Software panes can be switched between ascending and descending date sort, whereas it used to be ascending (oldest first) on Software, and descending (newest first) on Blog.

### *4.0.5 (06/19/2020)*
------------------------
- Sadly, all good things must come to an end, even v4.0.4.
- Inactive panes are now set to `display: none`, primarily for CTRL+F reasons.
    - The content of inactive panes no longer interferes with CTRL+F searches.
    - This will probably prove to be convenient for other reasons as well.
    - I was worried this would interfere with the animations and scroll-position-saving, but it just works.
- Feedback on Admin page is now sorted by date, for my sanity.
    - Fixed bug where feedback submitted on the same day overwrites older feedback from that day.
- Grammar tweaks on Museum page, and general spelling fixes throughout the site.
- Added v4.0.4 commemoration to Museum.
- Dots in image galleries are now dynamically generated, so I don't have to keep copy-pasting them.
- Adjusted hover animation for circular image gallery arrow buttons.
- Changed input placeholder text colour to be more readable.
- CSS tweaks to 404 (the error) page.
- Removed SM64TT site, since that has now been properly preserved at https://the404devs.github.io/sm64tt/
- Adjusted CSS to accommodate software entires with 3 buttons.
- Fixed CSS, so that webpage content fills the whole screen width on screens larger than the one I'm currently using.
- Updating blog posts and such from the Admin page now invalidates the cache, so changes will be reflected on the main site immediately.
- Minecraft server now runs 1.16.1, text changed accordingly.

### *4.0.4 (06/17/2020)*
------------------------
- #### This version number will only happen once, enjoy it while it lasts!
- Fixed bug where nav menus from inactive panes would interfere with interacting with active pane
    - Inactive panes are now set to z-index -1
- Plenty of admin page polish, not that you'll ever see it
    - Moved "Sign out" button to header, alongside new "Refresh" button that, well, refreshes the page with the up-to-date db contents.
    - Styling changes to email feedback viewer.

------------------------
- Added filter to Software pane, as promised.
    - Specifying a tag (eg: "Games") shows only entries with that tag.
    - Works the same with languages (eg: "C#").
    - If both a tag and language are selected, only entries with that tag and language combo are displayed.
        - eg: all "Games" written in "C#"
- Added the 404 Museum, a showcase of the404's history.
- Slapped a tab on each non-index page that takes you back to the homepage, if clicking the logo wasn't obvious enough.

### *4.0.1 (06/08/2020)*
------------------------

### *4.0.0 (06/07/2020)*
------------------------
- Archived 3.X version, found under the `old3` directory.

    - Removed old blog and software JSON files.
- Replaced PHP code that reads data from JSON files to generate site with JS/jQuery code that reads from Firebase.
    - Firebase code found within `js/firebase.js`
    - In order to reduce the amount of read requests sent to Firebase (there's a limit of 50k per day), the DB is cached, and we use a cookie to validate the age of the cache. We only update the cache DB if the current cache is over an hour old, or if the cookie magically disappears.
- Altered archives that use PHP to simply use a snapshot of a generated index. These include `old2`, `old3`, `birthday`
- Separated Birthday archive from the main site, cleaning the place up a bit.
- New feedback system. Instead of directly emailing me, feedback is saved in the Firebase DB.
- Bottom of the "About" pane got a clean-up.
- Migrated site from 000webhost to GitHub Pages.
    - RIP scottmsenior777, brutally murdered in his sleep.
